# Vacation and Sick Leave

Taking time off and recharging is critical to doing your best work at Clef, so in addition to the recognized [Holiday List](https://github.com/clef/handbook/blob/master/Benefits%20and%20Perks/Holiday%20List.md), Clef offers 3 weeks (15 days) of paid vacation every year that accrues 5/4 of a day per month of work. Employees should schedule their vacations, let the rest of the team know, and add it to their shared work calendar at least a week in advance.

Employees also accrue 1 hour of sick leave for every 30 hours of work, but cannot accrue more than 5 days of sick leave. Once an employeeâ€™s balance reaches 5 days, they may accrue more sick leave only by taking some sick leave to bring their balance back below the limit.

Employees should report vacation and sick days to the founder they report to, who will mark it in the payroll system (which keeps track of accrued days and should include them on every pay stub).

Employees with chronic or terminal illnesses should talk with the founder they report to about their needs for remote work, flexible time, disability leave and/or other support.
