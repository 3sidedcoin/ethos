# One-on-Ones

1-1s are time dedicated for you with your manager, in a private space. These meetings are critical to your professional life and you should take them seriously. The point of 1-1s is _not_ for your manager to give you feedback! This is time for you to discuss how you’ve been doing, how you’ve been feeling, recent problems you might have had, personal things potentially affecting work… anything! It’s your time to have a dialogue about things outside of what you’re directly working on.

## Scheduling

One-on-ones should be a recurring calendar event, but the schedule is meant to be regular, not rigid. The meeting can be moved if another event is happening at the same time or if the team member feels like they need more time on a given week. The important thing is that the meeting happen.

## Agenda

The meeting is driven by you, and your manager will be a passive listener. This is uncomfortable for a lot of people coming from organisations where “meeting with a manager” means bad news, so here are some pointers to get started:

- Anything that can be discussed in the open with the rest of the team, probably doesn’t need your valuable 1-1 time. Use team feedback sessions for those things. This is not a status update meeting!
- Talk about what’s been going well overall, or perhaps what has not been going so well. Ask for direct feedback on specific things you’ve been involved in.
- Brainstorm about something that you want to try or do, but don’t want feel comfortable discussing with the rest of the team.
- Talk about an area you’ve been trying to improve in, or grow in. Perhaps ask for guidance or suggestions. Ask for guidance with a promotion and the journey towards it. 
- Although it might be difficult to begin with, talk about something awkward that might be at the back of your head. Be brutally honest! This is private space for you alone. 
- Ask for support and advice.
- Give feedback to your manager -- What can they do better? Have they been ignoring something that you think is important? 
- Keep a private list of things to discuss during a 1-1, especially if you tend to forget little things that you might want to talk about later.

Agendas for different one-on-ones can vary widely, but this is the team member’s meeting, so they should have ultimate control. one-on-ones should be a mix of present problems/resolutions and future goals/plans. What is blocking today and how can it be resolved or worked around? What do you want the future to look like, and what are the concrete steps you’ll take to get there?

## Following Up

Your manager will create a private document shared between just the two of you. It’s useful to take notes during the meeting, so that you can ask about how things have changed in the future. It’s also useful to take notes between meetings -- if you notice something that you’d like to talk about, a note will make sure you address it in your next one-on-one.
