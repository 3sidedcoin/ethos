# Security practices

Our devices (computers, phones, tablets etc.) contain a lot of private and confidential data belonging to us and our clients. If you’re logged into your Obvious accounts (email, drive, remote servers etc.) on any device, you must take extra precaution that the data remains safe. As a general rule, you should try and limit the number of devices that have any work-related data.

Most modern Android and iOS devices support hardware encryption of data, and have it enabled by default. However, macOS computers do not have full-disk encryption enabled by default and you must enable it yourself — you should do this *as soon* as you get your computer!

In macOS, open System Preferences. Go to Security and find the tab called “FileVault” — that’s what Apple calls full-disk encryption. Once you enable it, the system will generate a decryption key that you should note down (ideally a physical medium; definitely not on the same computer!) and store somewhere safely. If this key is lost and you ever forget your password, it will be impossible to recover any data. The encryption process should take less than 30 minutes to finish, and you can keep working while it happens.

## But why?

It is important to know why full-disk encryption is important and necessary. Most people are unaware that if you have a physical access to a computer (pretty any computer running Windows, macOS or Linux), and the storage is not encrypted... you can simply reset the administrator password and get access to all the files. Modern operating systems come with a recovery mode built in that allows this; the only way to truly secure your files is full-disk encryption. However, this can’t be done remotely so one needs the computer in front of them, which means this is a real possibility if your computer gets stolen.
