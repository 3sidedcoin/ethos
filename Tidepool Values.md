# Tidepool Core Values

## People with diabetes own their own health data. We are stewards of that data.

We believe that people with diabetes, PwDs for short, own their health data, including therapy data collected by the devices they use. We are stewards of that data; we protect it with the utmost care and attention to privacy, accuracy, security, and usefulness.

## Openness and transparency.

As a company, we will toperate openly and transparently. We will not keep secrets unless there is a good reason to do so (such as to maintain user privacy).

This includes things like:
* Open source code
* Open finances
* Open project planning
* Open user experience designs

## Start small and iterate quickly

We believe that the best path to a safety, efficacy, usability and functionality that matters is to start small

## Embrace regulations, and help improve them.

We operate in a highly regulated space, including FDA regulations, HIPAA, CE and much more. Wherever we can, we will interpret regulations in a way that is best for PwD safety and efficacy. We will engage early and often with regulators, and whenever possible work with them to embrace modern software development techniques and processes.

## We don't have all of the answers.

As a company, we realize that we won't have all of the answers. That means that it's important for us to listen to our users, and iterate often based on their feedback.

## We're a non-profit so that we can always put the PwD first.

We have chosen to be a non-profit so that we can always prioritize the needs of the PwD over industry or investor desires.

However, we can have the most impact within the diabetes community if we are able to generate revenue and become a self-sustainable non-profit.

## Be better today than yesterday.

Being better is more important than being the "best", because "best" means complacency and better means progress. We are always improving. Improvement requires reflection, so we take ownership of our mistakes and question our habits.

## Treat others the way they'd like to be treated.

Our customers and teammates have different needs from our own, so we must consider their perspectives to communicate effectively. We work best together when we empathize with one another, and we create the best product when we understand the people we are building for.

## Fight the default of exclusion.

Inequality and exclusion are the defaults of our industry. Without intentional effort, we will inherit those failings and worsen the problem. Building a diverse team is a moral imperative and we build a better business and product by bringing different perspectives to the table. We look for voices unlike our own because they are the only ones that help us grow.

## We succeed together when we trust each other.

Trust is the currency that powers every interaction on teams. Only when we trust each other can we share the candid feedback and opinions that let us be creative and successful. We give our coworkers deep visibility into how our decisions are made and easy outlets to help them give input and guide our course. When we build trust through good communication, we create an environment for better communication in the future.
