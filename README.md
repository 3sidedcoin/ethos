# Handbook

### We stand on the shoulders of the giants.

First, a thank you. The Handbook you read is adapted from the Obvious Employee Handbook, itself a derivation of the [Tidepool Employee Handbook](https://github.com/tidepool-org/handbook/) and the [Clef Employee Handbook](https://github.com/clef/handbook/). These are/were available to all via a Creative Commons license, and for that we are very thankful.

[3 Sided Coin](http://3sided.co.in) is a work-in-progress in building a value-driven, inclusive company. That’s an easy thing to want and say, but it’s difficult to practice because exclusion is often the default in our industries (both software and consulting). It takes active effort to find the hidden biases in our companies and remove them.

This repository contains policies that we implement and want to implement at [3 Sided Coin](http://3sided.co.in). The policies on the road-map are marked as such. We acknowledge that we might be biased but we are also open to debate and introspection. 

Feel free to fork this repository and use any or all of these policies, and to modify them in whatever way makes sense for your company. We hope that by publishing them, other companies can benefit from our research and make their own policies more inclusive.

All feedback and suggestions (especially in the form of pull requests) are  appreciated. We’ve gotten several different perspectives to help arrive at these policies, but we are certainly missing many more and making mistakes as a result. This is a work in progress that we hope will get better with more time and more contributors.

If these policies sound like a culture that you want to contribute to and build, write in [tejas@3sided.co.in](tejas@3sided.co.in).
