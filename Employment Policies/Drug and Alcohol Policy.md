# Drug and Alcohol Policy

Our priority at Tidepool is to create a safe, comfortable, and productive environment for everyone we work with. We realize that drugs and alcohol can contribute to a culture of harassment or one that feels unsafe for some employees, even as it can foster camaraderie and friendship among others. Above all other considerations, our drug and alcohol policy is intended to preempt and avoid harassment and make working at Tidepool feel safe.  

Alcohol may served at Tidepool events, such as at team dinners or at Tidepool team offsites. **It is the responsibility of every employee to ensure that their individual consumption is not making anyone else feel uncomfortable or unsafe.** Employees who violate this policy may face disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

Illegal drugs should not be used, bought, sold, or distributed working either in the office or outside of the office or while representing Tidepool.
