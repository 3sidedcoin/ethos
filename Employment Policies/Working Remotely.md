# Working Remotely

## Overall Philosophy

Tidepool is a highly distributed team, and we embrace remote work. We currently have employees living in 5 states in the U.S. (California, Georgia, New York, North Carolina and Pennsylvania) and in 5 countries worldwide (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, U.K. and U.S.). While working remotely can be a challenge, we do our best to make it effective. Here are some of the things we do:

## Slack
## Weekly All Hands
## Working-On
## Time-zone Sensitivity
