# Working Remotely

## Overall Philosophy

Tidepool is a highly distributed team, and we embrace remote work. We currently have employees living in 5 states in the U.S. (California, Georgia, New York, North Carolina and Pennsylvania) and in 5 countries worldwide (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom and United States). While working remotely can be a challenge, we do our best to make it effective. Here are some of the things we do:

## Daily Scrum Standup

On Mondays through Thursdays we hold a short "standup" meeting where we report on work we are doing and any impediments. This typically takes place at 8pm or 9pm UTC, and adjusts based on regional Daylight Saving changes. (See “Time-zone Sensitivity” below.)

## Weekly All Hands

We hold a weekly virtual All Hands meeting where we talk about the highlights from the prior week. This typically takes place Wednesdays at 8pm or 9pm UTC, and adjusts based on regional Daylight Saving changes. (See “Time-zone Sensitivity” below.)

## Slack

We have both internal and external Slack instances for communication:
* Internal: [tidepoolteam.slack.com](https://tidepoolteam.slack.com)
* External: [tidepoolorg.slack.com](https://tidepoolorg.slack.com)

The external Slack instance is used for communication with our users and the open source community.

## In-person Offsites

We get together at least twice per year in person for a whole week to work, reflect on the past 6-9 months, strategize and plan the next 6-9 months. We typically rent a house (or two) and try to work in something fun like hiking, biking or kayaking. Past locations have included Santa Cruz, Palo Alto, Mountain View, Sunnyvale, and Fall River Mills, California.

## Working-On

We use WorkingOn.co to keep everyone on the team informed about what we are working on during the day.

## Time-zone Sensitivity

This is challenging given how distributed we are. In general, there is only one hour in the day when everyone is awake. We try to schedule meetings in a way that is sensitive to participants’ locales. Employees in Australia and New Zealand may need to wake early, and employees in Europe may need to meet in the evening or at night in order to make this possible.
