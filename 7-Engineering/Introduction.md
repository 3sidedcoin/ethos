## High alignment, high autonomy 
Alignment and autonomy are two important axes which can be used to classify teams:

1. _Low alignment, low autonomy:_ micromanagement culture, shut up and follow orders, teams have little understanding about why they’re moving in a particular direction
1. _Low alignment, high autonomy:_ helpless leaders, teams do whatever they want, things go everywhere and nowhere at the same time
1. _High alignment, low autonomy:__ strong leadership and organisation direction, yet leaders end up giving instructions to teams on what to do and how to do it too
1. _High alignment, high autonomy:_ This is where we want to be! Leaders focus on what problems to solve; teams are strong and independent enough to figure out how to solve them!

To get this degree of alignment, our teams must adhere to a set of non-negotiable standards — The Obvious Way — which include… 

* A common vocabulary to enable strong communication
* Code formatting and style guide
* Pull requests and reviews
* Git process and trunk-based development 
* System architecture
* Daily standups 
* Iteration planning 
* … and more!
