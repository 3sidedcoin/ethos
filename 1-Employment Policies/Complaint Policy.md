# Complaint Policy

Obvious is committed to creating a safe work environment that is free of threats to the health, safety, and well-being of the people who work here. That includes (but isn’t limited to) harassment, discrimination, violation of health and safety rules, and violence.

Obvious has a virtual open-door policy, so employees are encouraged to report work-related concerns. If something about your job is bothering you, or if you have a question, concern, idea, or problem related to your work, please discuss it with Rahul as soon as possible. If for any reason you don’t feel comfortable discussing it with Rahul, feel free to raise the issue with any of the other founds or anyone on the Board of Directors. We encourage employees to come forward with any workplace complaint, even if it’s not about something that’s explicitly covered in our written policies.
