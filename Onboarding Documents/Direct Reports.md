# Org Charts, Direct Reports and Providing Feedback

At Tidepool, we're still tiny and we're not so big on org charts, so you won't fine one here.

In general, everyone at Tidepool either reports to Howard or to Brandon. Folks working on QA and Customer Support report to Brandon, and everyone else (engineering and design) reports to Howard.

Not that it matters much. Since we value openness and transparency, you are as likely to get direction or feedback from Howard and Brandon as you are from one of your peers. We depend on that. **If you have feedback for someone, please just give it to them.** Be polite and honest. It's not a big deal, and they will appreciate it. As a general rule, if you have feedback for someone, it's your responsibility to give it to them directly - it's not OK to talk about someone else without also being willing to talk to them directly. Also be sure to thank and congratulate folks when you think they are doing great work, too. The more the better.

We are not doing any official performance reviews yet. Frankly we have yet to find a system that we think works better than "always share your feedback directly with people." Do it early, and often, and do it constructively.
