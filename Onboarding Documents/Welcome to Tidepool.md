# Welcome to Tidepool

Hey! Welcome to the Tidepool team, we’re so excited to have you with us. We’re hoping you’re going to learn a lot working here and that we’ll learn a lot from you. But first, this document will help you start figuring out how Tidepool works and how we work together.

At Tidepool, we’re trying to build an inclusive, mission- and value-driven organization, so you’ll find that a lot of our policies differ from the norm at other companies. If you have any questions about why we do things a certain way, or have a suggestion about how we can do anything better, please let us know (or just write comments in the documents -- you should already have comment access to everything in the Tidepool handbook!).  

## Your First Day

Hopefully by the time you’re actually starting at Tidepool, you’ve already finished filling out the paperwork and you’ve got a computer and other accessories that fit your work-style. Today is all about getting you set up and making sure you’re ready to go.

**The goal for today is to make sure you are set up with all of the tools you need, that you are set up to be compliant with our security/privacy requirements, and that you are ready to take on your first assignment.**

Here are suggestions for what you may want to accomplish on your first day:
* If you are developer, you'll probably want to make sure you can build and run our app locally.
* If you are a designer, you'll probably want to ready through our style guide and pick up a small design task.
* If you are a support person, you should read through incoming tickets, and maybe even reply to one!

You'll be assigned a first-day buddy, so if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask! No matter what, make sure you introduce yourself to the entire team, and be sure to show up to our daily standup meeting. Your buddy will help make sure it's on your calendar.

We want you to stick around. Your successes here will be your team’s successes, and your team’s successes will be yours. We want you to build a career here, so don’t feel any pressure to cram everything into today -- you’ll have plenty of time to get things right.

## The Basics about Tidepool

**Tidepool is a mission- and values-driven company.** Hopefully you heard about this a lot during your interview process, but we take our mission and values really seriously at Tidepool and they guide the decisions we make here. You can read more about [Tidepool's Mission](https://github.com/tidepool-org/handbook/blob/master/Mission%20Statement.md) and [Tidepool's Core Values](https://github.com/tidepool-org/handbook/blob/master/Tidepool%20Core%20Values.md).

* Be better today than yesterday

* Treat others the way they'd like to be treated

* Fight the default of exclusion

* We succeed together when we trust each other

**Tidepool isn’t a normal security company.** Security is traditionally a very technical and inaccessible field. At Tidepool, we’re working to make security easy and approachable to everyone, and that radiates through everything we do. Our product is meant to be friendly and fun, and our attitude should never feel superior or smug. Tidepool isn’t about protecting people, it’s about empowering them.

**Our ambition is huge.** We want to build the identity standard for the Internet. This is a massive undertaking, and we have to be a little bit delusional to believe that we can do it. But every day we’re making progress and we’ve already taken this a lot further than anyone said was possible, so we’re used to making the impossible happen. This is hard, daunting work, but that’s how we make a dent on the world.

## The Tidepool Team, Hours, and Office

For now, Tidepool operates as a single team where everyone is working towards company-level goals. Since we’re still small, there’s not too much overhead in keeping up with everyone. There are still engineering-specific meetings, and marketing conversations that happen separately. But when we set our goals, we all think directly about how we contribute to the company goals. You’ll get to work with everyone at Tidepool in some capacity, and dip your fingers into all different kinds of thinking.

We believe that if you have too much on your plate, then you can only see what’s right in front of you. You need space and time to think about the future and plan ahead. If we give ourselves room to breathe and think and live, we’re capable of much broader thinking. To achieve that, we try to create a culture that’s not based on scarcity.

You should expect a typical workweek at Tidepool to be 45-50 hours. Most people show up between 9 and 10 and leave between 6 and 7. We don’t work weekends, but a lot of us host or go to events at night. This is to give you a sense of what’s normal here, but you should work the hours that are healthy and sustainable for you.

We try to make the office atmosphere welcoming and respectful for people of all different backgrounds. This is an ongoing process of negotiating and compromising as we share space, and depends on good communication. If there are specific things you like or want to change, let us know. We’re always getting better :)

## The Future

Tidepool is a small company that is changing and improving rapidly. Today is about welcoming you and helping you join our team, but soon we’ll need your help growing and learning. Tidepool will be a very different company a year from today, and it’s hard to imagine what it will be like in 5 or 10. You will have a hand in building that company, and we’re so excited to have your help.
